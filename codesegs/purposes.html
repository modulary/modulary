<p>The following are the purposes for various code segments. Each code-segment
is a PHP file called from within a function, located in this directory, who's
filename is the prefix "cs-" followed by the name of the code-segment followed
by ".php".</p>

<p>
The return value of the script will be returned by the calling function as well.
</p>

<p>
The code-segments are called in <em>require</em> mode so that there will (if the server is so-configured) be error-output in the event of a missing file.
</p>

<p>
The <b>$codeparam</b> local-variable is where the identifier of the code-segment is stored.
</p>

<table border = "1" cellpadding = "3">


<tr><td>act_as_logged_on</td>
<td>tbi</td>
<td>
This code-segment will be called if and only if a user is presently logged
on to the system.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>but_not_logged_on</td>
<td>tbi</td>
<td>
This code-segment will be called <em>unless</em> a user is presently logged
on to the system.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>is_logged_on</td>
<td>ip</td>
<td>
This code-segment will return FALSE if no user is presently logged on to
the system.
However, if a user <em>is</em> presently logged on to the system, it
will return TRUE after an object named 'userinf' is created in the
anchor object with all relevant user information.
